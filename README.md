# Documentation for my HomeLab setup v2
This is a writeup of my current homelab setup. If you are reading this, I have probably intrigued you.
This repository will also link to any related Repos, like templates, scripts, ansible roles, etc. That is, if I have chosen to make them public.

Why Version 2? Because this setup has evolved multiple times and has been rebuilt from the ground up at least once, so I'm not comfortable calling it V1... 😉
